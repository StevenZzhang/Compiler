Creating variables:
This code lets you create int and string variables. The declaration is simple.
Ints: int a 5
This creates an int of the name “a” of the value “5”.

String: String str “boo!”
This creates a String of the name “str” of the value “boo!”

Calculation:
It is possible to use the functions +, - , *, /, % in the code
To do this, create a variable to store them in
Int sum 5 + 6
It is also possible to do with variables
Int a 5
Int b 6
Int sum a + b
Sum will be equal to 11

Printing:
Print can type variables, strings, and ints (no calculations).
The code will check if the printed is a variable or not
Ex:
Int b 7
Print b (will print 7)
However
Print a (will print “a”)

If statements:
To use an if statement, create a condition and statement
Ex:
Int a 5
If a == 5
Print “1”

Loops:
There are for loops only
To use a loop, simply type “loop x” - where x is the times you want it to run
Ex:
Loop 5
Print cat (will print cat 5 times)

User input:
This only takes string values
Ex:
Input name (name is the name of the variable)
If the variable name already exists, the value will be set to that old variable
If it is a new name, a new variable will be created;

Errors:
If the code is unrecognized, the message “Error in the code: + code” will appear
If the code is dividing by 0, the message “Math Error in the code: + code” will appear.

Miscellaneous:
To comment, write // before the code
Cannot directly print operations, need to create a variable of an operation then print that
Ex: print 5 + 6 (doesn't work)
Int sum 5 + 6
Print sum (works)
